Hello! 👋 

This repository contains 63 scripts I created as part of my **Scripting Fundamentals (COSN-206)** course during my final semester at **Long Beach City College (LBCC)**. These assignments showcase my journey through learning and applying essential scripting concepts across both **Windows** and **Linux** environments.

- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching and text manipulation
- **Input/Output**: Reading and writing files
- **Textual Analysis**: Processing and analyzing text data

This course emphasized hands-on experience with **popular scripting languages** (e.g., Python, Bash) and their application in real-world scenarios.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each script in this repository represents a unique assignment or project from the course, covering a wide range of topics and techniques. The files are organized to reflect the progression of concepts taught in the class.

### Highlights:
- Scripts are compatible with **Windows** and **Linux** systems.
- Each script demonstrates the practical application of a specific concept or technique.
- Includes examples of both **simple tasks** and **more advanced projects**.
